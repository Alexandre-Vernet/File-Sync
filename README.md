## Description

How do you send files from one device to another ?

Imagine, you have a directory on your computer with a lot of files, and you want to send them to your phone. How are you
doing that ? You send them by emails or by FTP ? You create a WeTransfer ?

Maybe you plug a USB drive to your computer, and you want to send all your photos from your phone to your computer.

That too long and boring to do manually. You want to do it automatically.

So I decided to create a tool to do that : "File-Sync".

File-Sync is a tool to transfer files from one device to another quickly.
